# ST Language Support

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/highlightjs/highlightjs-structured-text.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This repository provides syntax highlighting for Highlight.js for Structured Text. ST is one of the 6 languages of IEC 61131-3 standard developed in 1998 for developing PLC programs.

We want to provide ST syntax highlights in VS Code Markdown editor and Markdown preview. And other cases when tutorials are published in the web.
